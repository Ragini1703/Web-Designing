Pugs are an intelligent dog breed, but they're not the most intelligent dog breed out there. What is this? Their stubborn nature can make them difficult to train, and they don't always listen well. However, they can be trained to do tricks and perform simple commands. They were considered to be good luck because their forehead wrinkles resembled the Chinese character for “prince.” Emperors kept Pugs as lapdogs, and they were often guarded by their own soldiers and even given small castles.Pugs are so expensive for a number of reasons. They are considered a pedigree breed and they're in high demand due to their popularity amongst dog lovers. The Pugs' litter size is relatively small and often requires an expensive C-section to give birth
